## 🔧 Key Aimbot Features

This isn’t some shaky, janky hack. This is a fully customizable aim mod built for modern FPS combat:

* **Head/Chest Bone Lock** – Target specific hit zones (head = fast kills, chest = less obvious)
* **Silent Aim** – Enemies drop, but your aim doesn’t visibly shift
* **Triggerbot** – Auto-fire the moment someone steps into your sights
* **Prediction System** – Compensates for movement, latency & bullet drop
* **Custom FOV** – Tight or wide lock angles for subtle or aggressive aim
* **Smoothing** – Keep your movement human-like, avoid insta-snaps
* **Auto Switch** – Instantly re-lock to next target after a kill

🔥 Bonus: Works with all weapons — from SMGs to DMRs to snipers.
